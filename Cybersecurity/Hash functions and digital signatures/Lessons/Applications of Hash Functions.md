# **IV. Applications of Hash Functions**

Hash functions have a wide range of applications across different fields, especially in security-related tasks where data integrity and uniqueness are crucial.

## **A. Data Integrity Checks**

Hash functions are commonly used to verify the integrity of data during transmission or storage.

- **File Integrity Verification**: Before and after transferring files, hash values are generated to ensure the data hasn't been altered. If the hash values match, the data is confirmed to be intact.
- **Data Storage**: In secure databases, hash values can be used to detect unauthorized changes, alerting system administrators to potential data tampering.

## **B. Password Hashing and Storage**

Passwords are rarely stored in plaintext due to security risks; instead, they are stored as hashes.

- **Password Hashing**: When a user creates a password, the system stores a hashed version rather than the plaintext password.
- **Salting**: To further secure passwords, a random value called a "salt" is added to each password before hashing. This ensures that identical passwords produce different hashes, even if users choose the same password.

## **C. Digital Signatures**

Hash functions are integral to digital signatures, where they ensure data integrity and authenticity.

- **Hashing for Signature Creation**: The data is hashed before it is signed. The signer then encrypts the hash with their private key to create the signature.
- **Verification Process**: The recipient decrypts the signature using the public key, retrieves the hash, and compares it to a freshly computed hash of the received data. If they match, the data has not been tampered with, and the signature is verified.

## **D. Blockchain Technology**

Hash functions play a crucial role in blockchain networks, such as those used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

- **Transaction Verification**: Each block contains a hash of the previous block, creating a chain that ensures the integrity of all transactions in the network.
- **Mining Process**: Hashing algorithms are used in mining, where miners solve complex mathematical problems involving hash functions to add new blocks to the blockchain.
