# **V. Introduction to Digital Signatures**

Digital signatures are a cryptographic tool used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. By using digital signatures, individuals and systems can ensure that data has not been altered and that it originates from a legitimate source.

## **A. Definition and Purpose**

A **digital signature** is a unique cryptographic value created by applying a hash function to data (like a document or message) and then encrypting the resulting hash with the sender’s private key. The purpose of a digital signature is twofold:

- **Authenticity**: Confirms that the message or document was indeed sent by the claimed sender.
- **Integrity**: Ensures that the data has not been altered during transmission. Any changes to the data would result in a different hash, invalidating the signature.
- **Non-repudiation**: Provides proof that the sender cannot deny sending the message, as only the sender’s private key could generate the signature.

## **B. How Digital Signatures Work**

Digital signatures rely on both **hash functions** and **asymmetric encryption** to ensure secure and verifiable communication.

1. **Creating a Digital Signature**:
   - The sender applies a hash function to the original data to generate a unique hash.
   - The sender then encrypts the hash with their private key, creating the digital signature.
   - The signature is attached to the original message or document before transmission.

2. **Verifying a Digital Signature**:
   - The recipient uses the sender’s public key to decrypt the signature, revealing the original hash generated by the sender.
   - The recipient also hashes the received message independently.
   - If the hash from the decrypted signature matches the newly generated hash, the data is verified as authentic and unaltered.

Digital signatures are widely used in secure communications, document verification, and online transactions due to their reliability in confirming data integrity and authenticity.
